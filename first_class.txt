Let's take some notes :) 

Neural networks Hyperparameters : 
1. Number of hidden Layers
2. Number of nodes in a Layer
3. Number of EPOCHS
4. Learning Rate
5. Batch Size
6. Activation Function
7. Back Propagation Technique
8. Regulation Technique


Image classifier : 

1. Load the images 
2. Convert images to numbers / and resize them to be the same size


Image data shape : (n, width, height, rgb)
n = Number of images we got
